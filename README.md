Automate your scalable application deployment on OpenStack with Terraform! ‚òÅÔ∏è Infrastructure as Code made easy.

## üìù Description

This project leverages Terraform to automate the deployment of a scalable application on OpenStack. It sets up a robust environment with web servers, a database, load balancers, and firewalls, allowing you to deploy your application with ease.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Fully Automated Deployment:** Deploy your application on OpenStack with just a few commands.
* **Modular Infrastructure:** Well-organized Terraform files for easy management and customization.
* **Advanced Networking:** Configuration of multiple subnets and security rules for optimal network security.
* **Load Balancing:** Utilizes OpenStack LBaaS (Octavia) for efficient traffic distribution.
* **Custom Firewall:** Implements OpenStack FWaaS for enhanced security.
* **Dynamic Scaling:** Easily scale your web servers based on demand.

## üèóÔ∏è Project Architecture

The application environment consists of:

* üåê **Web Servers:** Three Nginx web servers for serving your application.
* üíæ **Database:** A dedicated database instance.
* üíª **Administration Server:** SSH access for management.
* ‚öñÔ∏è **Load Balancer:** Distributes traffic evenly across web servers.
* üõ°Ô∏è **Firewall:** Restricts unauthorized access.

## üìã Requirements

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

* OpenStack account with administrative access (version >= 1.53.0).
* Correctly configured OpenStack credentials.
* Terraform installed (version >= 0.14.0).

## üöÄ Installation and Usage

For the first execution, please check the ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning section at the bottom of this document.

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/Alejandro-Fdez-Gon/terraform-openstack-network.git](https://github.com/Alejandro-Fdez-Gon/terraform-openstack-network.git)
    cd terraform-openstack-network
    ```

2.  **Initialize Terraform:**

    ```sh
    terraform init
    ```

3.  **Preview Changes:**

    ```sh
    terraform plan
    ```

4.  **Apply Configuration:**

    ```sh
    terraform apply
    ```

    To customize variables, modify `terraform.tfvars` or use command-line flags:

    ```sh
    terraform apply -var="num_servers=6"
    ```

5.  **Destroy Environment:**

    ```sh
    terraform destroy
    ```

To use variables with values other than the defaults, modify the `terraform.tfvars` file or directly via the command line. Example command-line usage for the variable associated with the number of servers:

  ```sh
  terraform apply -var="num_servers=6" 
  ```

4. To destroy the environment:
  
  ```sh
  terraform destroy
  ```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning

For the first execution, it will be necessary to make certain modifications to the `servers.tf` file as the image used to create the database does not exist by default.

Modify the resource `bbdd`:

  ```sh
    resource "openstack_compute_instance_v2" "bbdd" {
        name            = var.bbdd_name
        image_name      = data.openstack_images_image_v2.jammy.name
        flavor_name     = data.openstack_compute_flavor_v2.m1-smaller.name
        key_pair        = openstack_compute_keypair_v2.key_bbdd.name
        security_groups = [openstack_networking_secgroup_v2.my_security_group.name]
    
        network {
            name = openstack_networking_network_v2.nets[0].name
        }

        user_data  = file("cloud-init-bbdd")
        depends_on = [openstack_networking_router_v2.router]
    }
  ```

Afterwards, take a snapshot of the resource and execute the following command to create the image:
  
  ```sh
    openstack image create --container-format bare --disk-format qcow2 \
        --file snapshot.raw bbdd-alejandro-fernandez
  ```

Destroy the resource `bbdd` and his key pair:
  
  ```sh
    terraform destroy -target="openstack_compute_instance_v2.bbdd" -target="openstack_compute_keypair_v2.key_bbdd"
  ```

Restore the resource `bbdd`:

  ```sh
    resource "openstack_compute_instance_v2" "bbdd" {
        name            = var.bbdd_name
        image_name      = data.openstack_images_image_v2.bbdd.name
        flavor_name     = data.openstack_compute_flavor_v2.m1-smaller.name
        key_pair        = openstack_compute_keypair_v2.key_bbdd.name
        security_groups = [openstack_networking_secgroup_v2.my_security_group.name]
    
        network {
            name = openstack_networking_network_v2.nets[1].name
        }

        depends_on = [openstack_networking_router_v2.router]
    }
  ```

Create the resource `bbdd`:

  ```sh
    terraform apply
  ```
